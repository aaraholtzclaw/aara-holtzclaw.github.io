				<p>Aara Holtzclaw is a recent graduate whose interest lies in the music industry. She received her B.A. in Strategic Communications from The Scripps Howard School of Journalism and Communications at Hampton University, and also completed The Pre-Law program. While on campus, Aara has maintained leadership roles such as, Vice President of PRSSA, (Public Relations Student Society of America,) and Concert Coordinator of the 2015 Homecoming Committee. In addition to her education, Aara has held professional positions at Sony Music Entertainment and The Source Magazine throughout her college tenure.</p>

				<p>In her spare time, Aara enjoys traveling, discovering new music and community outreach. While in her hometown of Boston, Massachusetts Aara was an active member of The Committee to Re-Elect Sonia Chang-Diaz, some of the major highlights of this experience were phone-banking and canvassing the many neighborhoods of Boston and educating citizens on important issues surrounding the community. During the Summer of 2015, Aara saved enough money to attend Drakeâ€™s OVO Festival in Toronto, Canada and see legendary artist like Pharrell Williams and Kanye West perform. It is the experiences like these when memories are created in which Aara finds value.</p>
